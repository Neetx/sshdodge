Tool developed to demonstrate the weakness of some ssh passwords.
It bypasses fail to ban protection changing ip with tor reload function, after some attempts defined in input by user.
Use these tool with consciousness.

Usage:
```
sshdodge.py [-h] [-u USER] [-i IP] [-p PORT] [-a ATTEMPTS] [-t] wordlist

positional arguments:
  wordlist              Wordlist for dictionary attack

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u USER, --user USER  User used to connection
  -i IP, --ip IP        Destination ip address
  -p PORT, --port PORT  Destination port
  -a ATTEMPTS, --attempts ATTEMPTS
                        Number of attempts before identity change
  -t, --test            Use the to test dependences
```


### for brute forcing when password is known

`sudo python username_dodger.py wordlist.txt -i pwspray.vm.vuln.land -p 22 -a 10 -P b84fc5c2`

Example:
```bash
sudo ./sshdodge -u root -i 127.0.0.1 -p 22 wordlist.txt -a 3
```

DEPENDENCES: You need to install on your system:
* tor
* sshpass
* proxychains

SYSTEM USED:
* Debian 9.2
